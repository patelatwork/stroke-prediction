## 📊 Overview

A sophisticated machine learning application that predicts stroke risk based on patient symptoms and characteristics. Built with Streamlit and powered by an ensemble of advanced ML models.

### 🌟 Key Features

- **Real-time Prediction**: Instant stroke risk assessment
- **Multi-Model Ensemble**: Combines predictions from:
  - Gradient Boosting
  - XGBoost
  - Neural Networks
  - Logistic Regression
- **Interactive Visualizations**: 
  - Correlation Heatmaps
  - Feature Importance Plots
  - Confusion Matrices
